[[def: Partial Disclosure]]

~ a disclosure of an ACDC that partially discloses its field maps using Compact Disclosure. The Compact Disclosure provides a cryptographically equivalent commitment to the yet-to-be-disclosed content, and later exchange of the uncompacted content is verifiable to an earlier Partial Disclosure. Unlike Selective dDsclosure, a partially disclosable field becomes correlatable to its encompassing block after its Full Disclosure.
